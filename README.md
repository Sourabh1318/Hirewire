## 🧠 What is HireWire?

**HireWire** is your AI-powered interview prep buddy — think ChatGPT meets LeetCode but with sass 😎  
It helps you prepare for technical interviews based on:

- 👨‍💻 **Role**
- 🧬 **Experience**
- 🎯 **Topics to Focus**
- 📝 **Extra Notes (we all got baggage)**

It spits out **10 questions by default** 🔥  
But hey, hungry for more? Tap that **Generate More** button. Unlimited prep — no strings attached.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack aka The Nerdy Stuff

- ⚛️ **React.js** (with Tailwind for that sweet drip)
- 🤖 **Gemini API** (for brainy question generation)
- 🌐 **Node.js + Express** (fast & furious)
- 🍃 **MongoDB** (because SQL is too mainstream)
- 🛡️ **JWT + bcrypt** (secure AF 🔐)
- 📱 **Fully Responsive UI** (mobile, tablet, fridge display — it adapts!)
